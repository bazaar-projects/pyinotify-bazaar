* History repeats itself.

1.0.0
=====

* Forked by Smarkets and renamed to pyinotify-smarkets because of the original
  repository being unmaintained; the Python module is still called pyinotify
* Backwards incompatible: Python 2/PyPy and Python 3.2-3.4 support dropped
* selectors module is used instead of select.poll so that the code handles cases
  where select.poll is not present
